14500_system
=====

This is an attempt at an MC14500b LU implementation in Verilog using 8bitworkshop as the development environment.

Don't expect anything great. I'm using this to learn Verilog.

The current goal is to implement the minimal reference system from the MC14500b handbook.

Because the LU utilises both edges of the clock, this version is not clock cycle accurate.
